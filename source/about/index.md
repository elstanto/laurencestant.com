## About me

<img class="profile_img" src="../images/helgrind.jpg">

I am a passionate engineer, originally from the Isle of Wight, who has recently completed a BSc (Hons) degree in Physics with Nuclear Astrophysics at the University of Surrey. For the past three years I have been a research student at the Advanced Technology Institute on the same campus studying metrology for nonlinear microwave devices, such as the power amplifiers used in mobile phones and satellites. This PhD degree is in partnership with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which has taught me principles of metrology and provided further training in instrumentation and measurement.

A proud supporter of free, open source software, I host all of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/helgrind/). I often extend this to my hardware projects, some of which are hosted on [Hackaday.io](https://github.com/helgrind/). I restarted the [Electronics and Amateur Radio Society (EARS)](https://activity.ussu.co.uk/ears) at my university five years ago, and we have just opened a new makerspace for students to work on personal projects around the clock.
